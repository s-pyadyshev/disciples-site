It is recreation of some screens and features from the game Disciples II: Rise of the Elves

- Main screen (hover buttons)
- Town building screens (except elves) with buttons to toggle building images

Technologies: Pug, SCSS, Gulp, JS, [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js), [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)

What is the reason to do this stuff??? Disciples is awesome, no objections.
